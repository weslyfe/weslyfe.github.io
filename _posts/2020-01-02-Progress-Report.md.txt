style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Browsing progress reports within <i>Progress
in Human Geography </i>and <i>Progress in Physical Geography</i> gives a reader
understanding of current developments in the discipline of Geography. Intersecting
the subdisciplines of physical and human geography my research involves two areas
of archaeological research. The first, an assessment of the utility of ground
penetrating radar (GPR), LiDAR, and remotely piloted aircraft (RPA)
technologies for understanding the Holocene evolution of coastal dyked
landscapes. Secondly, re-interpreting archaeological data at the Melanson
Village site (Nash &amp; Stewart 1990) along the Gasperaux River in order to
contextualize the story of human occupation prior to the Maritime Marshland
Rehabilitation Administration (MMRA). Building on the above two statements, considering
the archival, ecological, ethnographic, and geographic histories of past
intertidal landscapes on the Gaspereaux river valley in the context of their
archaeological data using GIS, remote sensing, and computer vision is the
general research topic. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:21.6pt;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Choosing progress reports broadly
relevant to my research unveils a remarkably large degree of cross-over subject
matter between Archaeology and Historical Geography often not represented at an
institutional level. Surprisingly, considering the intimate relationship with
dirt held by archaeologists and physical geographers alike, recent articles in <i>Progress
in Physical Geography</i> provided but few relevant progress reports. Relevant
topics on remote sensing applications, anthropogenic impacts to landscape, or
archaeological evidence as proxy data for understanding past landscapes were few
and far between, their ends were infrequently related to humans. For these
reasons, I am selecting only progress reports from <i>Progress in Human
Geography</i> as the subjects for the following paper: Cartography/Mapping
(Dodge 2017, 2018), Historical Geography (Offen 2012, 2013, 2014), and a second
Historical Geography (McGeachen 2014, 2018, 2019).  </span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Dodge’s collection happens to switch
titles from cartography to mapping from the first to second report (Dodge 2017,
2018). The first report is focusing on the subject of unlocking value in
historic cartography and new visualization techniques for communicating
geographies of the past through “so-called ‘deep-maps’” (Dodge 2017, p. 89).
Dodge’s second report (2018) focuses on applications focusing on more
contemporary subject matter: maps in the media (p. 949), geovisualizations and
digital geographies (p. 950), and visualization techniques from 3D GIS to
satellites, drones, and Google Street View (p. 952). The collection is engaging
in that it employs framing that is easily translated into inspiration. Even in
his criticism of how ‘deep maps’ are failing at one intended function of
communicating place-based information and understandings Dodge is careful and
fair in his treatment. If identification of weakness in Dodge’s collection was
forced, I may cite the change in title between reports that made it hard to
locate the second report in the collection. This may, however, be a clever and subtle
differentiation of the concepts of cartography and mapping in Dodge’s eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:28.8pt;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Modern geovisualization techniques
and applications offer up a range of topics broadly relating to my research
from making use of historic cartographies to geovisualization and communication
of geographic information. However, I chose Dodge’s collection not because of
the applications of new geovisualization techniques for contextualization of
past human landscapes or unlocking the value in historic cartography. However
integral both are to my research. Dodge’s collection references a novel use of
computer vision techniques in “automated detection of environmental
characteristics of place” (2018, p. 955) employed by Naik et al. (2017). </span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Dodge’s collection of progress
reports on cartography and mapping devotes a short section to the article by
Naik et al. (2017) applying computer vision to measure street change, taking
those results and calculating the ‘Streetscore’ (p. 7571) or perceived safety
of a neighbourhood. The applications by Naik et al. (2017) are debatably moral
and are a great example of poor framing of a valuable question. Dodge gives the
article it’s due credit for novelty and scope of the project then follows it up
in criticizing the ends of the project (2018, p. 955-6). The self-described
significance of the project is that “computer vision techniques, in combination
with traditional methods, can be used to explore the dynamics of urban change”
(Naik et al. 2017, p. 7571). There is no doubt that the application is noteworthy,
and the development of an algorithm for automated classification of urban
environments opens many doors from research to marketing to policy. Conversely
if applied to benefit commercial interests, an algorithm like this can close
many doors. Any utilization of masses of publicly available human perspective
imagery has the potential to preserve and intensify institutional racism and
other latent social inequalities. The application by Naik et al. (2017) does so
by categorizing lower class neighbourhoods as invariably unsafe due to
aesthetics, which can derive from economics rather than criminality. Diachronic
modern urban landscapes are not a large interest for me in terms of research,
though the field of computer vision and its applications are highly related to
my thesis research.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:28.8pt;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Computer vision (CV) is an
interdisciplinary field of research devoted to “extract[ing] meaning from
pixels” (Singh, 2019). The application of CV by Naik et al. (2017) involves
classification of environmental characteristics from pixels in photography,
while the application I intend to use is focused on automatically extracting 2D
surface area of archaeological materials from photography. The application will
use computer vision to extract a lesser utilized quantity for archaeological
analysis. The script used has been modified from a Python tutorial on measuring
the x, and y dimensions of multiple objects in an image and displaying the
results (PyImageSearch 2016). Additionally, the resulting tool extracts 2D surface
area from multiple objects in an image (<b>Figure 1</b>) and saves the data to
a CSV. Results can be appended to artifact locational data for use in
geospatial analysis.</span></p>

automated using computational methods is growing as computation devices become
more socially ubiquitous. Like all studies of the past, Archaeology is experiencing
fewer direct benefits from this development than contemporary studies where the
internet is facilitating the production of masses of relevant data. Archaeology
and other studies of the past may be waiting until knowledge of the skills
involved in computational methods becomes commonplace in society. As computer
programming is now being taught in Nova Scotian schools up to grade 6 since
2017 (Julie, 2017), general knowledge of computer programming will likely be
routine in future academic research.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>The second collection of progress
reports examined are authored by Cheryl McGeachen, a lecturer in Human
Geography at the University of Glasgow. Her collection is focusing on a theme
of ‘dark histories’ bringing critical approaches to studies of past people. The
first in the collection “Historical Geography I: What remains?” (McGeachan 2014)
brings the importance of scale in relation to research objectives through the
concept of ‘historical distance’ (p. 825). McGeachen then trifurcates the
concept into examples that highlight the diversity of scales to be cognizant of
in historical research using landscape scale battlefield and the relationships
between individual bodies in producing battlefield memory scapes (p. 826), the
psyche level scale of those affected by war and the relationship between trauma
and institutional scale reactions (p. 828), finishing with a critical focus on
the interplay of memory and memorialization (p. 830). The second piece in
McGeachen’s collection “Historical Geography II: Traces remain” (2018) is an
answer to the question posed in the title of the first: What remains? Here McGeachen
explores methods to highlight the issues that historical diversities pose to
historical research by presenting multiple framings of history and focusing on
the biographical lived experience rather than only actions (p. 136), the ability
of historical researchers to accurately engage or understand a life in full
through only traces, and finally a discussion about the ethical questions of
when narratives of the dying and dead are appropriate and how (p. 141). Lastly,
McGeachan’s “Historical Geography III: Hope persists” (2019) uses the
“intersections between historical geography, archaeology and the law” (p. 351)
to encourage more interplay between historical geography and archaeology, not
only in contemporary legally implicated scenarios, but on every possible front.
The report begins with an explanation of the intersections of archaeology and
historical geography (p. 352). The intersections of archaeology and historical
geography are then used as a single unit in the discussions that follow. This
intersection is used to contextualize how modern historical climatology is
being practiced, how archaeology and historical geography resurface and examine
dark histories as a means for “disrupt[ing] and unsettle[-ing] understandings
of time, place and self” (p. 356). The last intersection examined by McGeachan
(2019) is that which connects both previous topics to “Legal worlds” (p.357). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:21.6pt;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>McGeachan’s collection of progress
reports on historical geography are artful in their constitution, yet critical
in their assessments of practice and application. Though not quite reading like
a series, the titles of works in the collection give the reader a sense that
historical geographers and historical researchers alike should be aware of the
interplay between different academic disciplines and their applications to
contemporary issues. McGeachan’s question of “What remains?” (2014) bleeds well
into the answer in the 2018 title “[t]races remain” in historical geography.
The final report lets historical geographers see that “[h]ope persists”
(McGeachan 2019) in flushing out intersections and common ground in subject
matter between historical geography and archaeology. The only issue I can take
with this collection of progress reports comes from the lack of acknowledgement
of the applications of archaeological understandings to contextualizing and
humanizing temporally deep histories. McGeachan could have approached this
intersection in discussing the dark histories of “[b]odies and battlefields”
(2014, p. 826). It should be noted though, that the inclusion of an example so
divergent from the more contemporary subject matter may have been a seemingly
undesirable digression. Therefore, little criticism can be given to McGeachan
for that omission.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Lisa J. Hill (2015) invites
geographers to contemplate how “archaeological ways of doing” (p. 424) can
enrich geographical research, particularly cultural geography. The article is
highlighting the lack of communication between the disciplines as an
opportunity for future growth and collaboration. Beginning with the first
sentence, Hill (2015) grabs my attention by prefacing the discussion noting her
frequent astonishment of “the lack of interaction and dialogue between
archaeology and human geography </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:200%'>&#9472; particularly when it comes to theoretical debate</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>” (p. 412). The lack of
cross-disciplinary communication regarding theoretical frameworks is a question
I’ve often pondered myself, frequently and fortuitously leading to criticisms
of institutional structures rather than engagement with cultural geographical
theory and practice. Admitting her review to be selective by nature to fit in
the provided space, Hill still packs a lot of material into the article
focusing on time (p. 419) and matter (p. 416), the disciplinary place of
contemporary archaeology (p. 414), a criticism of the sanitized results
uncareful archaeology delivers (p. 422), and finally a conclusion presenting
how the “archaeological imagination” (p. 425) or archaeological approaches can
open up new directions in cultural geography. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:21.6pt;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Delivering her thoughts to an
audience of geographers makes this article no less relatable to an
archeological researcher wishing to apply human geographical ‘imaginations’ to
archaeological issues. In fact for an archaeologist, digging for hidden disciplinary
relationships and opportunities for archaeological inquiry in Hill’s (2015)
article feels akin to the archaeological imagination. This can be explained metaphorically:
an archaeologist excavates a trove of material culture (Hill’s article)
embedded in both discrete localized physical features (practical intersections
between geography and archaeology), and a larger landscape (theoretical
intersections of geography and archaeology). The material culture (Hill’s
article) is analyzed within both contexts (practical and theoretical) together
with an incomplete historical narrative relaying only one perspective
(applications of archaeology to enrich geography) to uncover implicit layers of
meaning (applications of geography to enrich archaeology). Both in metaphorical
and literal terms, the question is: how to understand the implicit meanings? Archaeologist’s
understand these answers are never direct and will likely not reveal themselves
so simply to a sleuth of only standardized techniques and metric evaluations.
It is nevertheless important for the archaeologist to carefully employ their
data in developing contextual understandings of how material and immaterial
characteristics of the archaeology relate to themselves and the broader past.
In the following, I attempt to pull geographical understandings from Hill’s
article to present opportunity for my own archaeological research.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:21.6pt;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>In a Canadian context Hill’s
assertion that “utilizing a whole range of sources and techniques … from
archival records to ethnography” (2015, p. 415) makes contemporary archaeology
unique is a bit misleading. It is understandable however, contextualized in the
United Kingdom where anthropology and archaeology are distinctive disciplines. 
Canadian archaeology is part of a ‘four pillars’ system in anthropology
consisting of archaeology, biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology,
and socio-cultural anthropology. Anthropological ‘training’ outside of
archaeology is a large part of an undergraduate for many archaeologists in Canada;
therefore, making use of ethnography and/or archival material becomes part of
routine interaction with the past. It is clear that the place of contemporary
archaeology in society varies by location, making specific examples in Hill’s
(2015) remarks about contemporary archaeology seem less relevant to Canadian
readers. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:21.6pt;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>The concepts of “material culture,
matter, and materiality” are deservedly treated to an introduction broadly
covering the development of modern archaeological theory (Hill 2015, p. 416).
Unfortunately, the treatment is not placed in the broader academic context
until after the story of archaeological theory development on approaching
“rematerialization” (Hill 2015, p. 417). I did not appreciate, before Hill’s reference
(2015, p. 418), developments in archaeological theory following Chris Tilly’s
(1994) publication <i>A Phenomenology of Landscape</i>. A balance between, or
situational applications of phenomenology and “symmetrical archaeology” (Hill
2015, 419) is a concept that seems second nature to me. Whether this be a
product of generation or my individual ignorance of recent developments in
archaeological theory, the materiality discussion by Hill (2015) is largely
relevant to my own research. In contextualizing material culture in space and
time, on past landscapes, I will be taking a phenomenological approach in
mapping and identifying patterns of distribution in archaeological materials.
While approaching these phenomena with an understanding that more than one
ontological lens is required for richer results in contextualization, it could
be said that symmetrical archaeology is being applied. Discussing symmetrical
archaeology is where Hill’s pinning of the two approaches to material culture
(2015, p. 419) in an ‘asymmetric dualism’ (p 418) is slightly ironic.
Symmetrical archaeology aims to move away from dualisms (Hill 2015, p. 418),
yet uses a dualism in her framing of it in opposition with phenomenological
approaches to materiality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:21.6pt;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>The subsequent sections in Hill’s
(2015) article cover the archaeological concept of time (p. 419) along with
absence and presence in archaeological methods. The former being presented in
the same format as the discussion on materiality, describing the conceptual
development of time in archaeological research then intersecting the concept
with human geography. The latter is a synthesis of the two prior discussions using
Derrida’s (1994) concept of spectrality and an application of it to
archaeology. The need to identify and examine past traces of humanity absent in
archaeological and historical records is necessary if an archaeologist or
historical geographer, it will only enrich the research outcomes. I feel
though, that spectrality only complicates the communication of the idea here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:21.6pt;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Hall (2015) commences concluding the
article reminding readers she is “advocating greater cross-disciplinary
collaboration” as her critical and detailed approach to archaeological concepts
of materiality, time, and spectrality may divert attention from the relatively
short references to cross-disciplinary interests, collaboration, and dialogue
at the end of each section. Presenting three possible cross-disciplinary lines
of inquiry, though I may argue after reading the article (Hall 2015) along with
progress reports on Historical Geography (McGeachan 2014, 2018, 2019) that
these three examples only scratch the surface of cross-disciplinary joint
research initiatives for geography and archaeology.</span></p>

progress reports examined here is another on historical geography, though quite
different than those put forth by McGeachan (2014, 2018, 2019). The final
collection is authored by Karl Offen working out of the University of Oklahoma
with a subtitle sequence following “Historical geography [I/II/III]:” of vital
traditions (2012), digital imaginations (2013), and climate matters (2014). Offen
covers broad subject matter of importance in relation to historical geography
and in contrast to McGeachan (2014, 2018, 2019) all works were written more
than five years ago making the analytical experience more reflective.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:21.6pt;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Offen uses the first section in vital
traditions (2012) to examine the place of historic maps and cartography in past
and contemporary social issues. Here, Offen (2012) is focusing on race
relations expressed through cartography, particularly in Latin American
contexts. The ensuing section covers geographies of knowledge, or the ways in
which knowledge relations geographically exist (p. 530). In this section Offen
questions the degree to which historic geographies are “subject to their own
geographies” (p. 530). By this Offen is touching on the subject of untold
geographies as Hill (2015) does in her questioning of what traces
archaeological materials render absent from its record. Offen then spends the
last body section of the report highlighting recent works on society-nature
relationships in the past. A type of study that parallels what I have heard
called landscape ethnoecology in archaeological circles. The first report is a
good high-level introduction into some subject matter that historical geography
covers. Offen’s reports that follow (2013, 2014) relate closer to my research
as an archaeologist, as they cover some more practical ways to analyze and
communicate results.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:21.6pt;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Offen’s (2013) “Historic geography
II: Digital imaginations” is the reason that I chose to cover this collection
of progress reports. The subject matter of digital representations of historic
research (p. 566), the impact of ‘the digital’ on humanities research concepts
(568), and a selection of digital mediums facilitating deeper conceptual
engagement with spatial information (p. 569). Though highlighting many concepts
lying close to my research, this article brings forth the subject for the
following critical analysis: Historical GIS (HGIS) (p. 568). The section on
HGIS is short yet brings forward relevant information by way of showing how
much has changed since 2014. One of the main ways the article illustrates its
age is in the nomenclature of HGIS. It is a term I have not heard in likely a
few years now. One possible reason for not encountering the term could be that
I have not been exposed to it; however, over the past four or five years that my
research has become more closely involved in GIS, my encounters with the term
have dwindled. It is likely that such a term is representative of a faddism
employed to attempt to sway more historical researchers into GIS. If true, the
faddism must have accomplished its goal, as it is no longer necessary. After
presenting forms of visualization media, Offen (2015, p. 572) asks in closing
“do we let the masters of digital technologies and the forces pushing them
usurp or define historical geography going forward, or do we bring our own
traditions and digital imaginations to the table”? I believe that the answer
lies in the business plan of the “masters of digital technologies” (p. 572) as,
when their product is being frequently applied for any use, digital companies
are more easily able to adapt to new requests, as upgrades to digital tools are
easier to roll-out than for their physical counterparts. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:21.6pt;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>The paper concludes with Offen
pushing for researchers to not make new technologies redefine previously
defined methods by bringing new tools to the conceptual playground (2013, p.
572). The framing Offen chooses in describing the adaptation of historical
geography to new technologies seems ignorant to the concept and truth that
computer technologies work for the researcher, and only in the ways the
researcher directs it to. This perspective fails to identify that opportunity
for researchers to allow computer technologies to expose biases in whimsical
classifications of phenomena and materials. A relevant example that comes to
mind in archaeology is artifact typologies, specifically lithics. At of the
time of writing a three-day old blog article at Medium.com tackles the issue of
lithic typologies in describing how <i>Projectile Point Typologies Are A Hot
Mess</i></span><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%'> </span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>(Inquiries, 2019). Not mentioned are
how computers may help in redefining typologies that were previously regional
or even more mind-boggling, site specific variants. I disagree with Offen in
thinking that technological tools are restrictive as his tone suggests. In contrast,
I believe that computational tools stand alone in being able to illuminate
human biases in research when they are deeply entrenched in and accepted by the

style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Offen’s third article (2014) entitled
“Historical geography III: Climate matters” challenges historical researchers
to engage more fully with how climate impacts lived histories (p. 479), examine
how climate is represented in society (p. 480), and to be cognisant of how
social and historical contexts shape public discourse on climate science (p.
483). As much as the subject matter is of interest to my research, such as the
importance of toponyms in documenting dynamic or processual characteristics of
climate (p. 484), the article is less relatable in the overall narrative it
provides. My research, however interwound with climate and landscape, is not so
much an effort to bring discussions of climate change into public discussion as
it is an effort to more holistically understand the deep past of the Bay of
Fundy. In this way, the final article by Offen (2014) falls short of providing
the applications necessary for me to relate the article directly to my
research.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:28.8pt;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>As previouslt mentioned, the second
article by Offen (2013) briefly introduces HGIS as a standalone approach rather
than an extension of GIS into the realm of historical research. There is no
inherent difference between HGIS and GIS, the tool will have the exact same
functions whether or not the data is indeed ‘historical’. I have chosen a
how-to book entitled <i>Historical GIS: Technologies, Methodologies, and
Scholarship </i>(Gregory &amp; Ell 2007) for my final critical analysis of this
paper. A book may seem like an odd analysis to focus on in such a short paper
as this, but the how-to nature and the aged subject matter make a publication
of this length easier to analyze in brief.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:28.8pt;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>The book starts out with an overview
of what HGIS actually is, and although I tend to disagree that it be defined as
its own subfield within geography or GIS, the authors eloquently describe the
nature of not only historical GIS but any specific application of GIS. Gregory
and Ell (2001, p. 1) explain that the most important questions to bring to a
GIS software is not about the analysis, but what the data actually represents,
and what it can be used to measure in its context. This ultimately speaks to
the nature of GIS in any research endeavour. Following this, the book does the
expected in providing a general overview of GIS and how it represents the
earth’s surface.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:28.8pt;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Gregory and Ell (2007) then examine
topics ranging from “Building historical GIS ddatabases” (p. 21), dealing with
historical data in GIS (p. 63), visualization (p. 89), time (p. 119), data
retrieval (p. 145), analysis (p. 161), and applications (p. 183) in the books
following sections. In many ways, the book can be viewed as a historical
document in its own right. The subject matter, softwares, and understandings
reflect a time before hope for rapid historical data acquisition was presented
by the widespread use of neural networks in automating handwritten text
transcription, and apparently, as noted by Retsima (2008, p. 173) in a review
contemporary to the writing, when “[t]he 3 ½” floppy disc is currently becoming
obsolete”. This review provides an overview of the “datedness” (p. 174) of the
concepts in the text, even upon release. Although giving credit to the authors
for its ability to meet “its objectives and the needs of the audience” (Retsima
2008, p. 174) the review is critical throughout of the dated material in the
book. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:28.8pt;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Dated material aside, the book goes
into deep enough detail to deliver fundamental nuances of historical data
within GIS when describing the use of a “gazeteer” (Gregory &amp; Ell 2007, 56)
to standardize vernacular spellings, errors in digitization (p. 46), and how to
handle error in GIs (p. 82). The book overall is a beneficial text for a reader
looking to gain a deep enough understanding of GIS to begin to self-educate about
the topic. I chose this publication, not because it is an easy target for
criticism, but for a reason connected to my own research. The reason being, the
intimate relationship HGIS holds with my own archaeological research. I
anticipate that much of my research data will be digitized and housed in a GIS
based database. Whether truly historic documents or digitizing and cataloguing
archaeological data for analysis, GIS will be fundamental in organizing and
analyzing many aspects of my research.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:28.8pt;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>To illustrate this point, I will make
a connection between HGIS, the archaeological archive, and the my research. The
topics of data digitization and visualization are areas which archaeology could
do a better job at engaging with. Too often, the allure of locating a ‘new’
site, or excavating an irreplaceable part of the human story are glorified as
the objective in archaeology. In an age so deeply rooted in the digital,
archaeology has yet to embrace the benefits that digitization can provide. From
visualizations to data synthesis projects, the digital age brings many new
opportunities. In my research, GIS will play a fundamental role in revisiting
past archaeological records from Melanson (Nash &amp; Stewart 1990).
Digitization of old data liberates the information in the archaeological
record, opening it up to new analyses. By revisiting archaeological records of
the past using new techniques, patterns not visualized in the past can be shown
in interesting and informative ways. <b>Figure 2 </b>shows density distributions
of artifacts per unit area in an excavation from the 1960s.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>               <span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>The benefit that such applications
have to archaeological research are largely in the ability of up and coming
archaeologists to revisit excavations with new theoretical perspectives and
questions. It is common knowledge that a person undertaking a stationary
activity is likely to not have any detritus from the activity land directly
below themselves. In this same line of thought, if artifacts are assumed to be
dropped or placed in contexts relative to the people interacting with them,
then the space between artifacts is the most likely place for a human to occupy
when performing an activity. Relooking at <b>Figure 2</b>, now reveals itself
not only as a visualization of the density of artifacts in an excavation, but a
representation of the human actions that resulted in the artifacts being
deposited. It may well be considered that the southeastern hearth in <b>Figure
2</b> shows evidence of people huddling around it for warmth, storytelling, or
in celebration during a meal in the midst of the Younger Dryas in Cobequid. New
questions asked of old data can begin to humanize the deep past in ways
previously impossible. It is for these reasons that I believe GIS and what is
known as HGIS are integral to my research.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:21.6pt;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>This exercise in familiarizing myself
and my research to recent developments and progress in geography has given me a
chance to understand many of the conceptual overlaps exist. Firstly, I had
assumed that physical geography in its out-in-the-field dirty nature would have
provided many more reports applicable to my research than I encountered. My
surprise, however, is apparently not shared by historical geographers who seem
to be well in tune with the cross-over of these practices (e.g.: Dodge 2017,
2018; Hill, 2015; McGeachan 2014, 2018, 2019; Offen 2012, 2013, 2014). These
progress reports have clarified the modern position of geography in relation to
archaeology to me and aided in connecting much of the content encountered in
this course.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:21.6pt;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>From concerns about what traces
archaeological methods omit (Hill 2015), to cross-disciplinary topics of
research interest, historical mapping and mapping history, the progress report
synthesis has provided much in the way of usable subject matter in my research.
The project forced me to consider readings from the course as well. Derrida and
poststructuralism were revisited on the topic of sprectrality (1994), the
quantitative side of human geography was grappled with, and the core of
geography and disciplinary boundaries were touched upon relatively frequently. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:21.6pt;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Though being the only analysis
without an image, Lisa Hill’s (2015) article on archaeology and historical
geography is the one article that stands out above the rest for relatability to
my thesis. Encountering geographic and archaeological theory in the same work
enriches the ability for researchers to spot the cross-over in these
disciplines. The concept of materiality, time and the considerations attached
to both are valuable insights to reflect upon as I begin to design my research
in a more formal sense. The result of this paper increases my geographical
literacy in terms of jargon, but the weekly readings may also be to thank in
part. </span></p>
